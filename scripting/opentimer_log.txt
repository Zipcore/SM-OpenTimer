Update log:
------------

-------------
	v1.4
-------------
	- Recording changed and file backwards compatibility breaks yet again (hence why version is 1.4 and not 1.3.x)!
		* DHOOKS is gone for good!
		* Recordings should be a lot smoother now.
		* Smaller frame size yet again.
		* Hopefully the last change made to the file structure.

	- Practice mode changes
		* Multiple checkpoints (five by default).
			* Commands !last/!lastcp to go back to the latest checkpoint.
			* !cp/!checkpoint <num 1-5> will bring you to the specific checkpoint. If user inputs no number, they get a menu.
		* Players can noclip using the command !no-clip/!fly. (I know the name sucks, but I don't want to override an already existing command.)
		
	- Anti-Doublestep Technology(TM)
		* Tired of your client-side autobhop failing? Don't worry, because we have a solution!
		* Usually the client-autobhop presses a separate jump key when you hold down your spacebar, etc. 
		* By simply binding your spacebar to '+ds', you can prevent doublesteps completely!
		* Do note that this is for those that doublestep (lose speed randomly when bhopping.)
		
	- Other:
		* Added more helpful commands like !version and !ds
		* Divided code into smaller files. Makes things easier to find.
		* Previously mentioned !cp and !lastcp changes.
		* Sync isn't super dumb anymore. It's just dumb now.
		* Again, made things more reliable and stable.
		* Menus aren't dumb anymore either.
		* Made !commands more easier to read, and to edit in code.

-------------
	v1.3
-------------

	- Moved to SourceMod 1.7 .
		* 1.7 syntax, yay!
			* const bug?
		* Will require 1.7 version of DHOOKS (v2.0) to compile.
			* You will have to do some changes in the dhooks.inc file in order to get it to work.
			* ^ There is an updated version in the DHOOKS thread if you're lazy.
			
	- Recording overhauled!
		* 1.2 records are not compatible with this new update!! Let me put this out there first.
		* Finally on par with other recording plugins. At least I think so :>
			* Recording is more precise. In fact, I'd say it's pretty much perfect now.
			* File sizes are smaller due to smaller frame size.
		* In case of the database being deleted, we now store the record time in the file header. Just in case...
		
	- Fixes:
		* People could leave the starting zone and start to float. No more...
		* There was a problem with one of the convars not working correctly. No more...
		* Made the plugin just generally more reliable.
		* Custom chat should show up now. It wasn't reliable.
	
	- Some components are disabled by default. (People don't necessarily want them.)
		* Map voting.
		* Custom chat processing.
		* Connect sound.
		
	- Other:
		* Added a new cvar 'sm_ezhop' to toggle EZHop. (def. 1)
		* Changed 'sm_autohopping' to 'sm_autobhop'.
		* Bots are now invisible.
		* Internal maximum players is now the default 64.
		* Made more SQL queries threaded. Meaning less hangups if at all.
		* Maximum recording changed to 45 minutes.
