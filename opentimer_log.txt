Update log:
------------

-------------
	v1.3
-------------

	- Moved to SourceMod 1.7.
		* 1.7 syntax, yay!
			* const bug?
		* Will require 1.7 version of DHOOKS (v2.0) to compile.
			* You will have to do some changes in the dhooks.inc file in order to get it to work.
			* ^ There is an updated version in the DHOOKS thread if you're lazy.
			
	- Recording overhauled!
		* 1.2 records are not compatible with this new update!! Let me put this out there first.
		* Finally on par with other recording plugins. At least I think so :>
			* Recording is more precise. In fact, I'd say it's pretty much perfect now.
			* File sizes are smaller due to smaller frame size.
		* In case of the database being deleted, we now store the record time in the file header. Just in case...
		
	- Fixes:
		* People could leave the starting zone and start to float. No more...
		* There was a problem with one of the convars not working correctly. No more...
		* Made the plugin just generally more reliable.
		* Custom chat should show up now. It wasn't reliable.
	
	- Some components are disabled by default. (People don't necessarily want them.)
		* Map voting.
		* Custom chat processing.
		* Connect sound.
		
	- Other:
		* Added a new cvar 'sm_ezhop' to toggle EZHop. (def. 1)
		* Changed 'sm_autohopping' to 'sm_autobhop'.
		* Bots are now invisible.
		* Internal maximum players is now the default 64.
		* Made more SQL queries threaded. Meaning less hangups if at all.
		* Maximum recording changed to 45 minutes.
